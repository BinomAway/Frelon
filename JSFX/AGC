// problems :
// gain is limited so there is still a noise floor that is too low
// alpha being too big >0.1  means the action is too fast and distortion appears
// alpha being too low <0.01 means the action is slower and big transients appear when volume goes up again
// using such algorithm reduces dynamics and diminishes SNR

slider2:0.25<0,0.5,0.01>target
